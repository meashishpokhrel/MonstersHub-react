Jquery Came first which manipualted DOM.
But it could only be used for samll projects.

IN react we have state which is like Javascript Object.

Then Came React, Uses components where it says just give me the state you
want and i will react. so the name react was used. Like poping notification number
in facebook to updating twitter feeds without reloading the whole web page or DOM.

React Idead...Smaller Components put together to form bigger Componets.
Components are simply javascript functions (or class).

React Developers must consider
Decide on Components.
Decide the state and where it lives.
What changes when state changes.
